This is the code to my badge.
It runs on a [Badgy 2C](https://github.com/sqfmi/badgy).

It cycles through various badges I need at various events,
and has a tiny version of Zork in it.
There's even an easter egg in there.

Note To Self
============

The board type is "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)".

Seems like you have to hold the button in and flip the switch to "on"
in order for /dev/ttyUSB0 to show up. After a few seconds it goes into
sleep mode, so you have to time it just right to get the program to upload.
